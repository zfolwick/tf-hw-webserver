# Getting the repo
Clone in the usual way, acquire the access and secret keys in the usual way, then run `terraform init`. The rest of this readme assumes you are using linux-based utilities (this was run on a mac).

This will bring in the aws provider resources into the local directory, creating a `.terraform` directory. Run `terraform plan` to see what changes will be made.

To spin up an ec2 instance, run `terraform apply`. The public ip address will be printed at the end. To automatically enter "yes", run `yes "yes" | terraform appyly`.

Creators may ssh into the machine using the public ip address displayed. If the ip address isn't displayed, just run `terraform apply` again. It should display.

After creation, an IP address will be displayed on the command line. You can navigate to the ip address via your web browser, wget, or curl. This is your basic web server.

When completed, run `terraform destroy` and validate in AWS console that the ec2 instance is actually destroyed.
